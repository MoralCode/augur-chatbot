### Background & Motivation

Augur Assistant transforms how Red Hat and the CHAOSS community access
project health data by layering a natural-language agent over our
OSPO-managed Augur database of 40K+ repositories. The capabilities and
goals of the tool are as follows:

-   Accessible Insights: Enables non-technical users (community
    managers, contributors) to run complex queries without SQL

-   Boosts visibility: Scans real-time metrics on Red Hat's open-source
    footprint and contributor affiliations, activity trends, license
    breakdowns

-   Proves small-model inference: Validated a lightweight MCP-powered
    pipeline (Llama Instruct 3B) for domain-specific agents, opening the
    door to low-latency, tool-exec AI workflows across the organization.

### Project ownership

-   Handoff to OSPO (post-Summer 2025)

    -   Formal transfer of code, documentation, and support for future
        planning responsibilities

-   Upstream community

    -   Opportunity to partner with the upstream CHAOSS community in the
        Data Science Working Group

    -   Some members of the community have expressed interest in
        AI/ML/agentic workflows. This project could be an area for them
        to work on. \*\* Especially integration with A2A

-   Long-term support:

    -   OSPO to maintain the production-hosted Augur Assistant instance.

    -   CHAOSS to own the open-source roadmap, issue triage, and model
        updates.
